# Wireframing

## Introduction
Wireframing is the process of creating a simple visual guide or blueprint that represents the layout and structure of a web page, mobile app, or software interface. It shows where elements like buttons, menus, and images will appear â€” without focusing on design details like colors or fonts.

## Importance of Wireframing in Design Process
- Clarifies ideas: Helps designers and developers plan how a system will look and function before development begins.  
- Saves time and cost: Changes are easier to make at the wireframe stage than during coding.  
- Improves collaboration: Allows teams and stakeholders to review and give feedback early in the design process.  
- Ensures better user experience (UX): Helps visualize how users will navigate the system and interact with features.  

Summarily, wireframing is an essential first step in turning design concepts into working, user-friendly products.
