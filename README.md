# Wireframing

## Introduction
Wireframing is the process of creating a simple visual guide or blueprint that represents the layout and structure of a web page, mobile app, or software interface. It shows where elements like buttons, menus, and images will appear — without focusing on design details like colors or fonts.

## Importance of Wireframing in Design Process
- Clarifies ideas: Helps designers and developers plan how a system will look and function before development begins.  
- Saves time and cost: Changes are easier to make at the wireframe stage than during coding.  
- Improves collaboration: Allows teams and stakeholders to review and give feedback early in the design process.  
- Ensures better user experience (UX): Helps visualize how users will navigate the system and interact with features.  

Summarily, wireframing is an essential first step in turning design concepts into working, user-friendly products.

## Key Elements of Wireframing

Wireframes are made up of several important elements that define how a product’s interface will look and function.  The key elements of a wireframe and how they contribute to the overall design include:

1. Layout Structure: This is the basic skeleton of the page. It shows how different sections (like headers, sidebars, content areas, and footers) are arranged. For example, in a hotel booking app, the layout might include a top bar for navigation, a main section for hotel listings, and a bottom bar for filters.

2. Navigation: Navigation shows how users move between different screens or pages. It includes menus, tabs, and links that guide the user journey. Example of navigation can be: a sidebar menu or a navigation bar with links like Home, Bookings, and Profile helps users easily switch between features.

3. Content Placement: This defines where information and visuals will appear on the screen, such as text blocks, buttons, or images. Example: In a booking system, hotel images might be placed at the top, followed by descriptions, prices, and a “Book Now” button.

4. Functionality: Functionality represents interactive elements that users can engage with, such as forms, buttons, or dropdowns. Example: A search bar where users can enter destination names or a date picker for selecting check-in and check-out dates.


## Types of Wireframes

### Low-Fidelity Wireframes  
Low-fidelity (lo-fi) wireframes are very basic sketches or digital outlines. They focus on structure and layout rather than design details like colour, typography or imagery.
**When to use:**
- Early in the design process, when you want to explore ideas fast.  
- When you want to get stakeholder feedback quickly with minimal effort.  
**What they look like:**  
- Simple boxes and shapes representing content areas.  
- Grey-scale or black-white only.  
- No detailed styling or final UI elements.

### High-Fidelity Wireframes  
High-fidelity (hi-fi) wireframes are much closer to the final design in terms of layout, spacing, and often include UI elements, real text, and interactions. They help visualize how the product will look and behave.  
**When to use:**  
- After the structure is agreed and you want to test user flows and experience.  
- Before moving into full visual design and prototyping.  
**What they look like:**  
- Detailed UI elements (buttons, icons, often real text).  
- More accurate spacing, layout, and sometimes colours and images (though still not the final design).  
- They can be used for usability testing before full design implementation.

## Example: Which type of wireframe is this?  
Link to the file: [Project Link in Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/E2BRqdPcKkrnX6hLGPto8Z/Project-Airbnb?node-id=1-2&p=f&t=YWLcisb8SiGfVtcW-0)  

Based on the look and level of detail of the design in the provided Figma project, the wireframe appears to be high-fidelity.  
**Why:**  
- It uses more complete layout details rather than rough sketches.  
- It includes UI elements that resemble the final product.  
- Using Figma suggests digital fidelity and refinement beyond simple hand-sketches.
