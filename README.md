# Wireframing

## Introduction
Wireframing is the process of creating a simple visual guide or blueprint that represents the layout and structure of a web page, mobile app, or software interface. It shows where elements like buttons, menus, and images will appear — without focusing on design details like colors or fonts.

## Importance of Wireframing in Design Process
- Clarifies ideas: Helps designers and developers plan how a system will look and function before development begins.  
- Saves time and cost: Changes are easier to make at the wireframe stage than during coding.  
- Improves collaboration: Allows teams and stakeholders to review and give feedback early in the design process.  
- Ensures better user experience (UX): Helps visualize how users will navigate the system and interact with features.  

Summarily, wireframing is an essential first step in turning design concepts into working, user-friendly products.

## Key Elements of Wireframing

Wireframes are made up of several important elements that define how a product’s interface will look and function.  The key elements of a wireframe and how they contribute to the overall design include:

1. Layout Structure: This is the basic skeleton of the page. It shows how different sections (like headers, sidebars, content areas, and footers) are arranged. For example, in a hotel booking app, the layout might include a top bar for navigation, a main section for hotel listings, and a bottom bar for filters.

2. Navigation: Navigation shows how users move between different screens or pages. It includes menus, tabs, and links that guide the user journey. Example of navigation can be: a sidebar menu or a navigation bar with links like Home, Bookings, and Profile helps users easily switch between features.

3. Content Placement: This defines where information and visuals will appear on the screen, such as text blocks, buttons, or images. Example: In a booking system, hotel images might be placed at the top, followed by descriptions, prices, and a “Book Now” button.

4. Functionality: Functionality represents interactive elements that users can engage with, such as forms, buttons, or dropdowns. Example: A search bar where users can enter destination names or a date picker for selecting check-in and check-out dates.
